Note:

1. Please run the Main class to execute the program

2. If using "JCreator", please remember to: 
	2.1 Run > Runtime Configuration > Click "<Default>" > Click 	"Edit..."
	2.2 Under "Run Application" tab, click "<Default>" > Click "Edit..."
	2.3 Under "Command" tab, uncheck "Capture output"
	2.4 Click "Ok" until you are back to the program screen

3. Reasoning for point 2 is due to JCreator's "capturing console" does not support 
   ASCIITable well, using it will cause "?" to be rendered instead of the "|" borders

4. Please place the HOLY.jpeg picture attached at the directory, otherwise,
   the report will be displayed correctly, but the picture won't be present:
"C:\Users\User\Desktop\HOLY.jpeg"
